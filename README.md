# Nava Frontend Repository

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Technologies used:
React, React-Router-Dom, Material UI, Material Icons

Technical decisions:
I chose React because it's a lightweight framework that is great for building reusable UX components and quick to develop in with its JSX templating. React-Router-Dom is the most common and most battle-tested library used with React for routing single-page applications. I chose MUI because it's supported by Google, it has excellent documentation and a wide range of features from color themes, components, and icons.

Choices that deviated:
I added an icon to the add new member button to make its purpose more intuitive. I added box shadows to the cards, button, and header to add emphasis in a way that is consistent with google's material design elevation principles.

Questions:
I would have asked if the "Marketplace" text in the header is a link or plain text. To me it looks like a "Facebook" header which is a link, that's why I used React Router Dom.
